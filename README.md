# i3-wm-config by benkaiser

This is my configuration for the i3 window manager.  

I have used both `awesome` and `i3` and felt `i3` is a bit more customizable. Try both of them before choosing if you hate working with mouse and dig tiling of windows.

I am still figuring out to get all the parts of the original repo working. Right now, the status bar is the default provided by i3.
`i3pystatus` is not being used. 


# Dependencies

- i3 - the i3 window manager
- py3status - for changing the status bar
- dmenu - for menu operations
- python3 - for my workspace controller script

# Keyboard Shortcuts

Mod + Shift + r = Restart i3 (reload )  
Mod + Shift + e = Exit i3  

## Applications

Mod + f = Make current window fullscreen  


Mod + Shift + 1 = Move window to workspace 1 in block

## Navigation. Changed to replicate vim bindings
Mod + h = Focus window to the left  
Mod + j = Focus window down  
Mod + k = Focus window up  
Mod + l = Focus window to the right  

(my block modifications apply to the following mods)

Mod + 1 = Switch to workspace 1 in block  
Mod + 2 = Switch to workspace 2 in block  
Mod + 3 = Switch to workspace 3 in block  
Mod + 4 = Switch to workspace 4 in block  
Mod + 5 = Switch to workspace 5 in block  
Mod + 6 = Switch to workspace 6 in block  
Mod + 7 = Switch to workspace 7 in block  
Mod + 8 = Switch to workspace 8 in block  
Mod + 9 = Switch to workspace 9 in block  
Mod + 0 = Switch to workspace 0 in block  

## Layouts
Mod + Shift+Control+h = Split horizontal layout  
Mod + v = Split vertical layout  
Mod + s = Stacking layout  
Mod + w = Tabbed layout  
Mod + e = Default layout  
Mod + space = Toggle between floating/tiling layers  

## System Manipulation
Volume Decrease Key (varies on keyboard) / XF86AudioLowerVolume = Lower volume by 2%  
Volume Increase Key (varies on keyboard) / XF86AudioRaiseVolume = Raise volume by 2%  
Volume Mute Key (varies on keyboard) / XF86AudioMute = Mute volume  

#Rhythmbox bindings
Shift+Control+space Play/Pause
Shift+Control+j Play Next Song
Shift+Control+k Play Previous Song

## Block Modifications
Mod + Left = Switch to workspace -1 (e.g. 1 to 0)  
Mod + Right = Switch to workspace +1 (e.g 1 to 2)  
Mod + Up = Switch to workspace +10 (e.g 1 to 11)  
Mod + Down = Switch to workspace -10 (e.g 1 to -9)  

The blocks refer to blocks of 10, so if you were on workspace 15 and pressed `Mod + 2` you would move to 12. The same applies to `Mod + Shift + 2` except it moves the window to the selected workspace.  

## Other Modifications
