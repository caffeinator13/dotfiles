All my dotfiles at one place.

I will delete the i3 and vim dotfiles repos soon.
I have merged them with this repo, so the version history
of the two repos is saved in this repo.

ranger for file navigation.

mpd and ncmpcpp for music (command line)

vimperator is a firefox extension

The present state of repo is not suitable for anyone to follow.
Still, if you are interested, you can have a peek. I will clean up
and write a more descriptive README later outlining all the features and
the setup process.

Look into install.sh to get an idea of the setup (regarding symlinks and git
    submodules for vim plugins).
