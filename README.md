All my dotfiles at one place.

I will delete the i3 and vim dotfiles repo soon.
I have merged them with this repo, so the version history
stays the same.

ranger for file navigation.
mpd and ncmpcpp for music (command line)
vimperator is a firefox extension

The present state of repo is not suitable for anyone to follow.
Still, if you are interested, you can have a peek. I will clean up
and write a more descriptive README later outlining all the features and
the setup process.

Look into install.sh to get an idea of the setup (regarding symlinks and git
    submodules for vim plugins).
